```

## Generate Assets dart code from assets folder

### With Flutter Gen

Install Flutter Gen

```bash

```bash
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner:
  flutter_gen_runner:
```

Run Flutter Gen
With command line

```bash
$ fluttergen -c pubspec.yaml

## Generate template code with mason_cli

View [document](https://github.com/felangel/mason/tree/master/packages/mason_cli#readme) for details

### Install mason_cli

Active from https://pub.dev

```bash
$ dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

Or install from https://brew.sh

```bash
$ brew tap felangel/mason
$ brew install mason
```

### Initializing

Get all bricks registered in mason.yaml run:

```bash
$ mason make bloc_module -o lib/modules
```
